Todo List
A simple and interactive Todo List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app helps users manage their tasks by adding, marking as complete, editing and deleting them in a visually appealing, user-friendly interface.

Features
Add Tasks: Add new tasks to your list.
Mark as Completed: Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from your list when they are no longer needed.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in local storage, so they remain available even after refreshing the page.
